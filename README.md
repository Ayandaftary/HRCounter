The pulsoid feed link should shart with `https://pulsoid.net/v1/api/feed/...` **NOT** `https://pulsoid.net/widget/view/...`

## Requirements
These can be downloaded from [BeatMods](https://beatmods.com/#/mods) or using [Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant/releases/latest).

Alternatively, you can also download them from their github repo.
* [BSIPA](https://github.com/bsmg/BeatSaber-IPA-Reloaded) v4.1.0+
* [Counters+](https://github.com/Caeden117/CountersPlus) v2.0.0+
* [BSML](https://github.com/monkeymanboy/BeatSaberMarkupLanguage) v1.3.4+


## HOW TO USE
1. Make sure all the required mods are working correctly
2. Download and extract the files into `Beat Saber/Plugins/`
3. Run the game once
4. Depend on your devices, follow the instructions below to configure the auto generated config file.
5. Run the game and enable this counter in Counter+'s counter configuration page

The config file is at `Beat Saber/UserData/HRCounter.json`

## DATA SOURCES
### Pulsoid
1. Open your pulsoid [widgets configuration page](https://pulsoid.net/ui/configuration).
2. Copy the link behine `Feed reference` in the **Advanced** section at the bottom of the page.
3. Paste this link in the config file as `"FeedLink": "https://pulsoid.net/v1/api/feed/..."`.
4. Set the value of `DataSource` to `"WebRequest"`.

Notice: The link should start with `https://pulsoid.net/v1/api/feed/...`.

### HypeRate
1. In the HypeRate app on your phone or watch, there is the session ID, which is also the few hex digits at the end of your overlay link.
2. Change the value of `HypeRateSessionID` to yours in the config file.
3. Set the value of `DataSource` to `"HypeRate"`.

For example, if your overlay link is `https://app.hyperate.io/12ab`, then your session ID is `12ab` and the config will look like `"HypeRateSessionID": "12ab"`

### Fitbit
1. Follow the instruction on [FitbitHRtoWS](https://github.com/200Tigersbloxed/FitbitHRtoWS/wiki/Setup) and set up your heart rate broadcast.
2. Change the value of `FitbitWebSocket` to `"ws://YOUR_IP:YOUR_PORT/"`.
3. Set the value of `DataSource` to `"FitbitHRtoWS"`

For example, `"FitbitWebSocket": "ws://localhost:8080/",` or `"FitbitWebSocket": "ws://192.168.1.100:8080/",`

## HR MONITORS

### BLE Compatible HR Monitor
1. Download [Pulsoid](https://pulsoid.net/) on your phone and set up heart rate broadcast.
2. Follow instruction for Pulsoid [above](#Pulsoid).


### Galaxy Watch
1. Use [HeartRateToWeb](https://github.com/loic2665/HeartRateToWeb) and [this](https://galaxystore.samsung.com/geardetail/tUhSWQRbmv) app on your watch.
2. Follow the instrucrion on [their github page](https://github.com/loic2665/HeartRateToWeb) to set up heart rate broadcast. Make sure you download the [**first**](https://github.com/loic2665/HeartRateToWeb/releases/tag/v1.0.0) realease, the csharp one is bugged.
3. Use [from file](https://github.com/loic2665/HeartRateToWeb#from-file) or [from /hr endpoint](https://github.com/loic2665/HeartRateToWeb#from-hr-endpoint) in the [OBS](https://github.com/loic2665/HeartRateToWeb#obs) section of HeartRateToWeb instructions.
4. If you decide to use "from file", then use the path to the `hr.txt` file generated by HeartRateToWeb as `file:///PATH/TO/THE/FILE`.
5. If you decide to use "/hr endpoint", then enter the feedlink as `http://YOUR_IP:YOUR_PORT/hr`

For example: `"FeedLink": "file:///D:/example/folder/hr.txt",` and `"FeedLink": "http://192.168.1.100:6547/hr",`


### Apple Watch
1. Download [HypeRate](https://hyperate.io/#footer) on your iPhone and Apple Watch.
2. Follow instructions for HypeRate [above](#HypeRate)

Note: You need to have testflight since HypeRate is still in beta.

Special thanks to iPixelGalaxy for testing!

### WearOS Smart Watch
There are 2 options.
1. Use [Heart for Bluetooth](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lukas.the.coder.heartforbluetooth) on your watch and use it as a BLE heart rate monitor. Then download [Pulsoid](https://pulsoid.net/) on your phone and follow instructions for Pulsoid [above](#Pulsoid)
2. Use [HypeRate](https://hyperate.io/) which you can download it on the [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.locxserv.hyperatewearos) and follow instructions for HypeRate [above](#HypeRate)

Depending on your watch, monitoring quality may not be as good as a dedicated heart rate monitor. 


### Others
When this mod is requesting hr data, it expects a string containing one of these:
* A json contains key `bpm` with int type value and an optional key `measured_at` with string type value.
* Only numerical digits. (Regex `^\d+$`)

It can be in a file or can be requested from a link. Then set `DataSource` to `"WebRequest"` and the link.

More data sources and devices are planned to be supported. See [below](#Data-Dources-To-Be-Supported).
